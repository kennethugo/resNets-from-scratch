# resNets-from-scratch
Building a very deep convolutional network, using Residual Networks (ResNets) 50 layers. 

# Objective
* Implementation of the basic building blocks of ResNets in a deep neural network using Keras
* Implementation of a skip connection in a deep network
* Bringing all these building blocks together to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification

# Reference
This is part of my part of the assignment of Course 4 (Convolutional Neural Networks, week 2) in the Deep Learning Specialization course!, deeplearning.ai. Some of this code are part of the assignment from deeplearning.ai
